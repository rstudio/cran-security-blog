If you are looking for ways to scan R packages for vulnerabilities, you may find the [oysteR package](https://www.jumpingrivers.com/blog/r-package-vulnerabilities-security/) interesting.

For more information on R package security at RStudio, please see [RStudio's support article](https://support.rstudio.com/hc/en-us/articles/360042593974-R-and-R-Package-Security).
